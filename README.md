# Prompt Compression

This is an unofficial, personal implementation of prompt compression proposed in
[Prompt Compression and Contrastive Conditioning for Controllability and Toxicity Reduction in Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.412.pdf).
Their official repo is [here.](https://github.com/BYU-PCCL/prompt-compression-contrastive-coding)

I found their idea to be simple and interesting, and since their code is not public yet,
I tried implementing it myself for my own research.
